How to install deno?

Open powershell

iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex


PS C:\Users\admin> deno --version
deno 1.2.2
v8 8.5.216
typescript 3.9.2
PS C:\Users\admin>


Hello.ts

console.log("Welcome to Deno")

deno run --quiet Hello.ts


deno run https://deno.land/std@0.63.0/examples/welcome.ts

Remote code is fetched and cached on first execution, and never updated until the code is run with the --reload flag.

Deno code is cached in %LOCALAPPDATA%



deno run --allow-read two.ts sample.txt

Q:

We don’t have any such permission issues in Java as well. Isn’t It ?


A:

We do have
We have SecurityManager class in java.util.security package

We can call SM class into our program

Java Applet - a small .class that is embedded into HTML page (client side code)
Java Applets by default can't access the local file system, can't connect to any network except frm the server it originated from

Two.ts

// deno-fmt-ignore
const filenames = Deno.args;
for (const filename of filenames) 
{
  const file = await Deno.open(filename);
    await Deno.copy(file, Deno.stdout);
  file.close();
  }

deno run --access-read Two.ts sample.txt

Three.ts

// Fetching contents from url
const url = Deno.args[0];
const res = await fetch(url);

const body = new Uint8Array(await res.arrayBuffer());
await Deno.stdout.write(body);


Run:

deno run Three.ts https://www.google.com (it won't work)

deno run --allow-net Three.ts https://www.google.com (it will work)


Uint8Array is used to unmarshall / decode / convert some special characters found in the website


*** If you want to install tsc ****

npm install --g tsc

tsc <<my-typescript-program.tsc>> --> will generate my-tpescript-program.js

transpilation - conversion from one language to another language

Here, we convert from .ts (typescript) to .js (javascript)

3.45

Take a break about 15 mins

4.00 pm


Q:
Can we run js file directly using deno, if I’m using bebel to transpire es6 to es5?


A:

Yes


MyModule.js

export function sum(x, y) {
  console.log((x + y).toString());
}


TestJS.ts:

// Deno code is going to use MyModule.js 
import * as mymod from "./MyModule.js"

mymod.sum(75,24);

How to get help?

deno -h
deno --help

If you want help on "run" subcommand

deno help run

https://www.typescriptlang.org/play

This is a good website for converting typescript contents into javascript contents


Five.ts

// Reading the arguments
console.log('length of the argument is ', Deno.args.length.toString());
for (const x of Deno.args) {
  console.log(x);
}


Currently, as on today, there is very minimal support from IDEs.
VScode provides a extension mechanism for deno

As an extension mechanism, in VSCode, you can search for deno extension


Let's say your module depends on remote module "a.ts"
When you compile yor module for the first time a.ts, is retreived from the remote location, compiled and cached

But, what happens if the cotent in the remote url is changed?

Deno suggests that you use integrity checking and lock files.

caching and lock files

Deno can store and check subresource integrity for modules using a small JSON file
Use the --lock=lock.json to enable and specify lock file checking

lock.json might look like this:

{
"url1/a.ts": "312",
"url2/b.ts": "400"

}

If you have modified in the url1, for the file a.ts, you should generate a different code:

{
"url1/a.ts": "313",
"url2/b.ts": "400"

}


Machine 1:

It will refetch the code if the number is different
Machine 2:

It is something similar to SERIALVERSIONUID in Java

Machine 2:

deno cache --reload --lock=lock.json url1/a.ts

Generate documents:

Calculator.ts

/**
 * Adds no1 and no2.
 * @param {number} no1
 * @param {number} no2
 * @returns {number} Sum of no1 and no2
 */
export function add(no1: number, no2: number): number {
  return no1 + no2;
}


generate document using:

deno doc --json Calculator.ts

Anything related to JavaScript, use VSCode

Other editors: there is atom,webstorm, sublime text editor, notepad++
Intellij
Eclipse with JS plugin


$ locale
SET LANG="en_US.utf-8"
SET LC_COLLATE="en_US.utf-8"
SET LC_CTYPE="en_US.utf-8"
SET LC_MESSAGES="en_US.utf-8"
SET LC_MONETARY="en_US.utf-8"
SET LC_NUMERIC="en_US.utf-8"
SET LC_TIME="en_US.utf-8"
SET LC_ALL="en_US.utf-8"

what is linter?

This is for static code analysis

You have declared "x" variables, not used them
There would be some "dead point" in your code
If you haven't followed the coding standards..
